# CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier
## Project Description

The goal of the project is to build convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. The project includes the following steps:
- Dataset exploration.
- Designing model architecture.
- Training and validating model.
- Testing model on test set.
- Testing model on new images.

### Project files
The project includes the following folder/files/link:
- ![Dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/February/5898cd6f_traffic-signs-data/traffic-signs-data.zip) - the dataset of traffic sign images 32x32.
- additional_images - the folder with additional images for testing neural network.
- Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb - the script with classification pipeline.
